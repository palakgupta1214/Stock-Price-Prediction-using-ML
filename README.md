# Stock-Price-Prediction-using-ML

Developed a Stock Price Prediction App that uses machine learning, specifically the ARIMA model, to predict stock prices based on historical and real-time data. Built with Python and Flutter, the app features real-time stock predictions, interactive data visualizations, and a user-friendly interface. The project leverages yfinance for data fetching and TensorFlow Lite for deploying the machine learning model on mobile. This app empowers investors with accurate predictions and personalized insights for better decision-making.

ðŸ’¡ Key Features:

Machine Learning Model: Implemented ARIMA for better accuracy over traditional models.
Real-Time Data: Fetches stock market data using the yfinance API.
User Interface: Developed with Flutter, including real-time predictions, customizable dashboards, and portfolio tracking.
Model Performance: Evaluated using metrics like MAE and RMSE, with an R-squared score indicating high accuracy.

ðŸ”§ Tech Stack:

Python (ARIMA, TensorFlow Lite)
Flutter (Mobile Development)
Firebase (User Authentication)
yfinance API (Data Fetching)
Matplotlib, Seaborn (Data Visualization)

âœ¨ Future Enhancements:

Real-time news updates
Portfolio tracking
Comparison with competitor stocks
